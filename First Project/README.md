With this project I want to take a look at the market for Airbnbs in Boston and in Seattle.
The goal of this project is to identify different charecteristics that define prices for Boston and Seattle and within each of the cities.
I also want to take a look at what attributes contibute to higher ratings for an Airbnb.

I used existing Datasets from Kaggle for [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston) and [Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle).
