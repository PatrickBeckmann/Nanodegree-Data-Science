This project is the Capstone Project of my Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.
For this project I analysed a dataset from Starbucks containing information about different offers that were provided to their customers.

The goal of this project was to create a model that is able to predict whether an offer will be successful or not.
All neccessary packages are referenced in the Requirements.txt file.

I also wrote an [article on medium](https://medium.com/@patrick.beckmann/success-of-starbucks-offers-7f64df027a07) about my project.
