Goal of this Notebook is to get an overview of the Data Science job market from 2020 to 2022 an gain insights about the distribution of remote-ratios, salaries and experience levels in the market.
For this cause a [dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries) was used.

For the analysis I followed the CRISP-DM Process.
After visualizing and analyzing my data I tried to answeer the following questions:
  1. How will the salary develop in 2023?
  2. Did the remote-ratio develop since the pandemic?
  3. Does the remote-ratio influence the salary?

In my [blog post on medium](https://medium.com/@patrick.beckmann/analysis-of-data-science-salaries-2d84f14cefee) I also wrote about my findings with this project.

- pandas==1.3.4

Visualisation
- seaborn==0.11.2
- matplotlib==3.4.3
- squarify==0.4.3
